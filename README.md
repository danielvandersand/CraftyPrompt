# CraftyPrompt
Take home prompt for Crafty Ruby on Rails Development Internship.

Please find [Replit link with code](https://replit.com/@DanielVandersan/CraftyPrompt "Replit link") if you don't want to download and compile the python file on your machine.

I also uploaded a pdf that contains what I wrote down as my inital assumptions, thoughts for implementation, and thoughts for future development of the code.
